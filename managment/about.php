            <p>ploa is meant to be a simple blog platform that can be easily added to an existing website. Since you are reading this it looks like that worked! ploa started as a means to get away from converting an RSS feed of Blogger for having a blog on my webpage. As I started working on it I wondered if there were many other things like what I wanted availble. Turns out there isn't that big of a market for embbedable blogs because I couldn't find very many. So I decided I would release ploa as I contiued working on it. This is my first project that I have made publicly availible and it is exciting!</p>
            <p> ploa is developed by <a href="http://www.akbkuku.org:8228/">Shelby Jueden</a></p>
