            <p>You can add formating such as being bold to your text when you post. To do it you put the text in braces and add codes like this:</p>
            
            <table>
                <tr>
                   <th>Open Brace</th>
                   <th>Format Tags</th>
                   <th>Semi-Colon</th>
                   <th>Text</th>
                   <th>Close Brace</th>
                </tr>
                
                <tr>
                    <td>[</td>
                    <td>b,u</td>
                    <td>;</td>
                    <td>This text would be bold and underlined</td>
                    <td>]</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>So typed into the writer page bold and underlined formated text would look like this, [b,u;This text would be bold and underlined], and would show up on the blog like this,  <strong><u>This text would be bold and underlined </u></strong>. Also note that you cannot nest braces so if you want to achive this, <strong> bold <u>bold and underlined</u> bold</strong>, you need to type it like this, [b; bold] [b,u;bold and underlined] [b;bold].</p>
            
            <p>Here are the avaible tags*:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>U: <u>Underlines the text</u></li>
                <li>B: <strong>Make the text bold</strong></li>
                <li>S: <strike>Strikes trough the text</strike></li>
                <li>I: <em>Italisizes the text</em></li>
            </ul>
            
            <small>*Capitalization does not matter</small>
